## ðŸ“’ Introduction

The project is based on a simulation of a digital songs player, where the user can perform a search through songs or artists/bands.

The project contains the following screens: 

- `Login`
- `Main page`
- `Song page`
- `Favorite Songs page`
- `Profile page`

At first it contains a login screen for possible verification of a DB to be created.

After validating the login, the user is redirected to the main page. The main page is a search page, where the user can search songs or artists/bands. After this, the search result is displayed in a placeholder, just below the search bar.

After carrying out the search, it is possible to select the album that the user chose, which was returned from the search. Clicking on the album, the user is redirected to a page that shows all the songs in the selected album. On this page, it is possible to listen to a preview of all the songs and select the song as a favorite.

There is a navigation bar, which is present on all pages, after the user logs in. In the navigation bar, it contains the project's logo, three links (which redirect to the search pages, favorite songs and profile) and at the end of the bar, it contains the name of the logged in user.
